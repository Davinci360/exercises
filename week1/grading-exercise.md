## For today's exercise, we're going to use scanners, if, else if, and else statements to grade an assignment. 

You'll write a Java program to take in a grade (integer) using the scanner and then provide appropriate output. 

Example, 90 or above would be an A. 

Example, less than 65 would be an F.
