## Research and Present a Built-In Java Class
- Research into a Java class that we haven't looked into, definitely use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html, w3Schools, GeeksforGeeks
- Make a short (5 minutes) presentation (use Google Slides, Prezi)
- Include a demo showing off the class (demo should take 3-4 minutes of the presentation time)
- Maybe about 10-20 lines of code, as a loose guideline
- No submission for this. Elect one team member to present to the class
- No repeats, message me on Teams to confirm your selection


### Examples
- Random
- Data
- Graphics
- Math
- String, make sure you look into some new methods
